# Video-Super-Resolution
This is a PyQt based desktop application that uses the ONNX Runtime to run Video Image Super Resolutions. ONNX models are converted from state-of-the-art Pytorch Models

[Original Super Resolution Repo. New Custom classes were created to make the Super resolution models compatible with ONNX's model export API](https://github.com/jixiaozhong/RealSR)
